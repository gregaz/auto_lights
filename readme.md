## Auto Lights ##
A quick python script that will turn the lights on when a device with a certain mac address joins your home network. 

Currently testing this on my raspberry pi zero.

Some scripts that can be useful:
get_ip_for_mac_address(mac_address) - useful for finding your raspberry pi's ip address on your lan when you know it's MAC address.
check_for_mac_addresses(mac_addresses) - useful to determine if certain devices are on your lan network.
